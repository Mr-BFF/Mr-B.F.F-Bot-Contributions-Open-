#Mr B.F.F Bot

This is my bot and it’s completely open-source for you to contribute and you can use it to make your own too! Simply just edit the bot.js file with a vaild txt js editor to get started and change commands! I am looking forward to upgrade to Python at some point but node js is fine.

Once you have contributed, please DM me on my Social Medias.

The bot uses Node JS v12.14.0.
The service is used for Discord. My token is not in the text files!

Download Node JS: https://nodejs.org/
Go to node.js command prompt and then type your file location to where you saved your bots code on your folder. Type that full path, ex. Cd C:\nodejs
Then type in node bot.js then hit ENTER.
The bot will go online.

Right click on the bot’s js file and then click edit.

This is what I want on the bot’s remaining features.
<li>English Command. Type command prefix - english, it deletes that user’s message, not in English then gives bot command - @mention - Please speak English in the chat, user!</li>
<li>A cool queue list, types in, prefix - queue then added to queue! If no queue is found, it will message queue not set up.</li>
<li>Invite Bot - This feature is added. Prefix - Invitebot then the bot gives an invite, authorize link to share and add to other parties, servers.</li>
<li>Light moderation commands:</li>
1.Kicks. Prefix - kick user
2.Bans. Prefix - ban user
3.Message Filtering, like inappropriate links, sensitive messages.</li>
<li>Ability to add roles. Prefix - rolename(get) then the bot messages then gives role to user.</li>
